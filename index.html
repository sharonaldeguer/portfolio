        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I’m an aspiring web designer/developer who loves everything about the web. I've lived in lots of different places and have worked in lots of different jobs. I’m excited to bring my life experience to the process of building fantastic looking websites.</p>
        <p>I proudly hail from the beautiful City by the Bay, San Francisco. I’ve been an accountant and operations manager in Goodby, Silverstein and Partners and DDB and TribalDDB Worldwide, advertising firms in San Francisco and New York, a salon manager for an exclusive high-end hair salon, and in operations for a luxury-homes remodelling construction firm. As of late, I was an agent's assistant for one of Hawaii's Top Producing Brokers in Commercial Real Estate located in Honolulu. I am now a property manager with five commercial properties in my portfolio located in the heart of Honolulu. More importantly, I am a life-long learner who's always interested, enthusiastic and excited in expanding my tech and design skills.</p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>I want to master the process of building web sites and increase my knowledge, skills and abilities in:</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>HTML5</li>
          <li>CSS3</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
          <li>Python</li>
          <li>Django</li>
          <li>Ruby</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Both front-end and back-end?! Yes, this is true. Both the user experience and user interface intrigues me as much as how a website is structured and running behind the scene. </p>
        <p>I’d like to work for a web design and development firm helping clients create an impressive online presence.</p>
        <p>I offer a fresh perspective dreamer-students are notorious for. "That's just how things have always been done" is not a solution that I opt for.</p>
        <p>Gimme a chance and I'll do what it takes to help your websites come to life and stand out amongst the rest!</p>
